# Filtered-Binary-Search-Tree

The purpose of this program was to take any body of text and then to create an index of the words mentioned, line by line. An additional text file is added that contains a list of words to ignore during the index process. 

To open this file use the Makefile by calling "make" and then "Driver.out input1.txt gsl.txt" .

Otherwise you can open in Visual Studio, be sure to add input1.txt and gsl.txt to your debug arguments!
